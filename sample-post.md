# My First Blog Post

This is the content of my first blog post. I'm using the Pelican Blog Extension for VS Code to manage my blog posts efficiently.

## Features

- **Draft Management**: Toggle between draft and published status
- **One-click Publishing**: Publish posts with a single command
- **Status Bar Integration**: See the current status of your post

## Getting Started

1. Write your blog post in Markdown
2. Use the frontmatter to set metadata
3. Use the extension commands to manage your post

Enjoy blogging with Pelican!
